    "This can be done from the command-line with ``git request-pull``, however the user interface and user experience is much better on one of the git hosting profiders like GitHub. In fact, the social and collaborative aspect of GitHub is resposible for a lot of their succecss.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Make some commits to improve the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - you can use the GitHub builtin editor, click on the crayon icon\n",

    "- Open a Pull Request on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Go to the pull requests tab, then click on \"New Pull Request\"\n",
