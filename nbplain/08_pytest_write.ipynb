    "## Skipping tests\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we saw that `pytest` could flag tests as `SKIPPED` and report information as to why this was the case. Let's look at one of the test functions to see how this was achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# mypkg/test/test_mymath.py\n",
    "@pytest.mark.skip(reason=\"Not yet implemented.\")\n",
    "def test_div():\n",
    "    \"\"\" Test the div function. \"\"\"\n",
    "    assert div(9, 2) == pytest.approx(4.5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have written a test for an, as yet, unimplemented function `div` that divides one number by another and returns the result. For a simple function like this the expected output is obvious so it's easy to write a test before the function is even implemented. We are asserting what the *output* of the function should be, not how it should be *implemented*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing tests before implementing functionality is often good practice and is referred [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Writing tests first can help to better structure your code. Once a test is written you should write the minimum functionality that makes the test pass, then add more tests, and refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have marked the test to be skipped by using `@pytest.mark.skip` with a reason given in the parentheses. Don't worry about this funny syntax. It is an example of what's known as a *function decorator*. We are *wrapping* our test function inside another function called `skip`."
